            "Comment": "I tried to start the charging session using the designated app, but it didn’t work. The hotel staff eventually started it manually, and the charging speed was only 10 kW.  The car was charging for 3 hours while I was attending a concert nearby. When I returned, the hotel charged me €21 for the session (I received just 29 kWh) and an additional €6 for parking.  This was by far the slowest and most expensive EV charging experience I’ve had. I would not recommend charging here. The app doesn’t function, and you have to ask reception to manually initiate the session — very inconvenient.",
