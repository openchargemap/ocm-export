            "Comment": "This chargepoint pictured on the side of the hotel still exists, but a new modern E-volt charging point has just been installed in a small public car park that faces the chargepoint pictured.  We examined it on Thursday the installation was not quite complete - when we drove back past on Monday (without stopping) the building works were all finished so perhaps the chargepoint is now operational.  The hotel told us that the local council would be the people who know more about it.  When the equipment works it looks like it will be a big improvement and the new unit will offer compatibility with more charger-types.",
