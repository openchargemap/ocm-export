            "Comment": "My Oyster card saved the day! Tried to charge using phone app but couldn't connect (GPRS - GiffGaff/O2). Tried my wife's mobile (3G - Three) which worked but could not initiate charge. We telephoned and a remote start was tried but this failed too. However, the operator/machine was able to accept payment via Oyster card and the charge started much to our relief. ",
