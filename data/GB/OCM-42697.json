As far as I can tell, despite no error messages anywhere and the lights on my Nissan Leaf's dashboard lighting up correctly, my car was not charged at all. \n\nI did do a quick check with the LeafSpy Pro app when I first plugged in, which suggested that it started charging at a very, very low level. When I got back my battery didn't show any increase at all.",
