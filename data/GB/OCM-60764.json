            "Comment": "Tried to charge using DC chademo on 4th March. The charge session cancelled itself immediately after started. I phoned the CYC helpline and they tried a remote start which also failed. They are going to report the problem to the council. Note this is a remote area and the nearest chargers are over 30miles away on mountainous roads. In other words you will get stuck like I did! ",

            "Comment": "Tried to charge at Braemar rapid on Sat 4th March. Using DC chademo it failed, despite showing as operational on CYC website. I phoned chargeyourcar, and they couldn't make it work either. They have reported the fault to the council. This is a remote location miles from any other chargers, I was effectively stranded. Luckily locals are friendly and helped out.",
