            "Comment": "On entering the car park, drive to the towards the exit the 2 bays and plug points are just before the exit barriers. They are marked up for staff use only, I asked at the car park office which is at same location and they confirmed these were the bays to use. The car park charges (March 2014) are £1.70 first hour £3.40 second hour then £5+ for third hour, I can't remember beyond that. ",
