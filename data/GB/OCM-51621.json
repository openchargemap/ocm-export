Screen blank, system off. Called the parking office who said the system was down.\n\nMet a lady with an Ampera on the 6th floor, exact same problem there.\n\nNo effort made to fix the system or inform users before entry to the car park of the problem.

Unfortunately anyone can park in the bays and they are often occupied by ICE vehicles. Not all of the points work, so look for the flashing green light to show it is ready. At present, you don't need to be a member of a charging provider.",
