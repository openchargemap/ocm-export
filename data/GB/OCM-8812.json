            "Comment": "Charged here at 56A on 70A tesla HPWC while staying overnight in the hotel. NB tested it at 70A and it worked fine; chose to dial it down a bit. The staff all know about the various chargers and were able to confirm all working well during the booking process: they checked with maintenance and then phoned me back which is a great approach. \n\nI could see the ZCW points at the other end of the car park but didn't try them.  \n\nBreakfast is exceptionally nice here! If you like cooked breakfast, have the Full Staffordshire. Rooms are very comfortable. ",

I charged here on 29 March 2011 using a 32A socket from their boiler room before they had the now-installed Zero Carbon World EVSE. \n\nI am really looking forward to the soon-to-go-in Tesla 70A HPC.
