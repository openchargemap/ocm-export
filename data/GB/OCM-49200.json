            "Comment": "Despite there being a big 'EV ONLY' sign on the tarmac in front of the two EV charging bays I often come across one of the spaces which has been ICE'd, quite often it is an ICE owner with a baby seat in the car as there is a sign in one of the EV bays, (just to add confusion), which states 'parent and child parking only'. This is obviously directed to an EV owner with a child in situ, as opposed to an ICE owner. I have had several 'moan' sessions with the folk in the Sports Centre but to no avail. Only once have had to wait due to both slots being occupied, (ICE plus Leaf).",
