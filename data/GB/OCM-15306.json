            "Comment": "On Sunday 02 Nov 2014 we successfully charged using the Chademo connector available at this station on two occasions, early in the morning and late afternoon. The point is in the car park of some council offices, and is ungated. The point is therefore accessible 24/7 for anyone with a Charge Your Car card, as far as I can see. The description of this point in openchargemap suggests access is limited to during office hours. It could be that the hours stated are the hours of opening of the council office, but this doesn't seem to affect access to the charge point. ",
