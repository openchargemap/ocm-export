            "Comment": "The ecotricity  station is a single EV bay offering either a DC charge point or the AC point, you cannot use both at the same time. Come off either carriageway at the Victoria/Roche junction. \r\nWestbound traffic come off the roundabout on the first exit towards Roche for about 100 yards taking the second left into the service station, follow the signs to the car park, the charge point is nearly at the bottom of the car park. Eastbound go across both roundabouts and take the road towards Roche for about 100 yards then follow the instructions above. Shame it is only 1 charge point, I have used it 3 times now, first time the machine was down because a previous charger had not used the 'stop charging' correctly ( a quick phone call to Ecotricity had it reset within 30 minutes), the second time was incident free but the third it was raining rather hard and a vehicle was there charging using the DC for 50 minutes! Not very thoughtful as I had 5 miles left and could get nowhere.",
