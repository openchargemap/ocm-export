            "Comment": "Worst charge at a Nissan dealer yet. First charge on our way down to Cornwall we arrived 10 minutes before Vospers opened & when we asked the Manager if we could charge he stated 3 times that they didn't open until 8:30 before finally putting put on charge.\n\nOn our return trip we called ahead again and said we would like to use the charger at 4:45, 15 minutes before they officially close. Arrived on time and was given the card and padlock key but the very nice young lady at the front desk. Come 5pm the arrogant and rude Manager was back and told us he was taking us off charge. He had no consideration as to whether we needed to charge for longer. It was funny though watching him try to stop the charger without the card, which we had, whilst he swore at his colleagues who watched on.",
