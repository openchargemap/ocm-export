            "Comment": "Couldn't charge as both levels had 2 cars parked and plugged in and the other bay had big bollards bolted down in front so couldn't access half the charging points? Maybe these are for electric bicycles? Was very disappointing :(\r\nBut well signposted and the fact they bothered to put in some sort of open access Charging facility is good - just wish every bay had a 13a socket!",
