I guess that when the roads get flooded more with all electric cars, people will expect more cars more often.\n\nThere was no problem with staff moving their cars.\n\nCharged our Zoe successfully,  without a hitch. As zoe's can be fussy with some \"Carbon World\" chargers.\n\nWe were staying over, so had free use of charging point. Otherwise you would be requested to stay for a lite bite and a coffee, while awaiting your car to charge.",
