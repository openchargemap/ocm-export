Charging points are the two white blobs by the timber building (plant shop) at the top of the able-bodied car park.\r\nAs I was about to leave, another Leaf pulled up and started connecting up to the 13A square pin charger as I was occupying the Type 2 .  Pointed out that the Type 2 was becoming  which was a significant help as that was a 7kW Leaf.  Leaving mobile number (which I did) not foolproof as there is no mobile signal in the cafe!",

When I said that I was a little corned about blocking both chargers the response was 'not to worry, we have only had 6 EVs visit this year'. I left a mobile number in the case another EV appeared on the scene - it didn't.",
