            "Comment": "Concur with previous comment by Zoe. Always ICEd and shop staff and so-called managers adopt a confrontational attitude, ordering EV users off the site when they complain about it. Car park monitoring company issues tickets if you stay more than three hours, even when you've had permission from the staff.  (Contested ticket. When I received no reply, I phoned and was told the ticket had been cancelled. Regulations require them to reply in writing within two weeks.) Suggest not only avoiding this site, but a complete boycott of.all ASDA branches until their attitude improves.",

Other people became quite confrontational because they felt show not be special places for electric cars.  I recommend avoiding this charger except as a last resort.",
