Bear in mind these are not RCs, so you'll need to be there a good few hours to get a decent charge. Luckily a very good pub opposite that does meals.",

As the centre is unstaffed at this time, I wasn't able to ask anyone about the status, but it's best to assume these don't work for now. The nearest alternative charger is at Balloch. ",
