            "Comment": "Friendly staff. Old Chargemaster post rubbish. Recently replaced with Chargemaster / British gas post. 32 A. Currently need to allow time though to get key to turn on to use. Then retrieve key to switch off so your cable will be released. Staff often currently unfamiliar where key is and this can take some minutes either end of charge. Tesco / Lidl / Bowling / other shops nearby. charging available only when open. Barrier comes up so retrieve car before 6, or 5 sat 4 sun.",
