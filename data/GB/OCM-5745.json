I mention this as I had a nightmare the day before with the older (wider) units installed eg at Reading - neither of which were working.  This experience and others a fortnight ago at Bridgwater and Sedgemoor - which also have the older chargers - leads me to think that they are generally not reliable and should be replaced.  I also believe the problems I had - eiterh a 'ground fault error' or a 'can recieving error' were due to the very wet conditions and that if all the Chademo chargers had some sort of canopy, things would be generally more reliable - and comfortable for users.",

(It's well worth getting as they focus on Welcome Break service statins to allow transit charging. And the card is currently free to all, not just Ecotricity customers). \n\nAs you approach on the motorway you are greeted with an EV with plug logo right under the \"Petrol\" on the main sign for Oxford Services. This is exceptionally welcoming and very refreshing to see EV refuelling on a par with ICE. I just drove in and there were three very well marked bays with bright green EV charging markings on the road (one has Chademo which I ignored, the other two Mennekes). Even though they were close to the front door they weren't ICEd. It was mid-afternoon, busy, so it has to be because they are so well marked. I was able to present my Ecotricity card still in my wallet to unlock the posts. Plugged in a Mennekes to Tesla cable and it started charging at 32A. No problems disconnecting at the end. Faster than a petrol station refuel in terms of time I spent at the car refuelling. \n\nThe actual motorway services are good and modern.",
