            "Comment": "There are two POLAR dual charging units (13A/32A). They are positioned round the back of the Waitrose busilding. To get to them just drive round the back of the main building. They are situated by the barrier. Staff at Waitrose have been told not to park there but very occasionally they are occupied by ICE cars but I have never seen all 4 bays blocked. The manager is very pro-EV.",
