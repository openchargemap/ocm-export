            "Comment": "The sockets are present and working and the folks at the ski centre were very friendly and helpful. They are three pin 'blue' commando sockets. However, they all have 6amp breakers on them. My charge cable for this type of socket draws 10 amps, so the trip would blow. There was a delay of about 2-3 minutes before this happened, so initially i though it was working. But when I returned to the car after skiing there was no charge! In theory if you have a charge cable that allows you to limit current, you could use these sockets, but 6amps is going to charge your car very slowly!",
