I managed to change because I was lucky when an ice car drove away and I just beat another ice that was about to take that spot. I've parked further away and walked past and not noticed them before. Which is why they are usually ICEd. I spoke to the checkout supervisor, who suggested that I should call the telephone number on the back of my receipt if I wanted to complain to someone. ",
