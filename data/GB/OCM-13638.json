Which is becoming more important in Bedford as electric car ownership is growing & now find I have to drive round to find a free space.. ",

            "Comment": "My second attempt to charge. After previous complaints, the signs have been turned round the correct way, but no floor marking present so both bays ICEd. There is very little visitor parking, so this is always going to be case - effectively these bays will always be blocked, although they may well be worth trying out-of-hours. If they are ICEd, then there is another charging point on the same side of the road about 100 metres further on immediately in the entrance to Bedford College. ",

The visitor car park bays on the other side of the post have no signage and are always blocked during office hours - may just be possible to charge out-of-hours.",
