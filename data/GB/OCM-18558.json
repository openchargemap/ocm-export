            "Comment": "There are 2 7Kw Type 2 charging sockets on a single unit. The unit is, as the previous comment states, damaged and on a slight angle. As such, the 'tilt' error keeps triggering. Other than this (which I hope is fixed soon) the unit is fully operational and worked with my PiM card. Cables don't seem to lock so there might be a potential unplugging issue. Bays are NOT marked for EV use but with a normal length cable you should be able to park in one of the 4 bays nearest the charger and still plug in.",
