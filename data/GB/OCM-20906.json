I dropped by to check if the point was working in my ICE as I was passing and had seen on another site (I think it was Ecotricity's) that the point was out of service a short while ago. I checked it out visually and all seemed fine EXCEPT that the Renault ZE charge lead was left lying on the ground with the charge plug in the mud. I picked it up (carefully) checked no mud was inside the plug fitting, wiped it down and put it back in the holster. I wonder if this may be a factor in some of the faults with some 'trickle grounding'?\n\nI've noticed at several other charge points that people seem to pretty much just throw the leads down, please make sure they are put back carefully it's not hard to do. I have to confess I do also tidy up petrol pump hoses too. I'm not OCD I just consider other users who follow on later. Of course it could be anyone who does this and I'm pretty certain some of the charge points I've seen messed up are as a result of mindless vandals but some are not.",

Also, we nearly missed the location of the point as it wasn't signposted and we ended up driving into the petrol station off the next turning at the services - luckily a man from the petrol station had a high vis jacket and was able to usher us back down the road the wrong way so we could get back to the charge point!",
