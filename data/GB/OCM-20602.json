After 15 mins drove back to bay and tried again, same error.\nRang Ecotricity helpline, the guy was very helpful.  He said that the charging station was fine, and had been used successfully 2 hours previously.  He suggested reversing the car 2 metres and then back again, which I explained I'd already tried. He restarted/rebooted the charging station and I tried again, same error.\nI asked if it was possible to get from North services to South services, to try the charger there.  He found a route via an obscure access road using google maps (I said he was helpful).  I followed his route, ignoring the 'authorised vehicles only' signs, and found the charging station at the southbound services.\n(At the southbound services, the charging worked fine, 72% charge in 36 mins.)\nI used the obscure access road to get back to northbound carriageway and continued my journey, after calling the helpline guy to update and thank him.",
