            "Comment": "when ever I pass it seams like the same Smart EV is parked in the spot. today is was there from around 9am until 2pm, and when it eventaully moved, I drove around the block, so I could charge, and found a mum had parked her Volvo XC90 in it.\r\nI've been here all day and was hoping I would get my 3 hour to charge at some point, but it looks like I might only get one. parking enforcement come around every hour on their scoters to ticket cars in residents bays, but don't appear to care about the EV spot, or the 3 hour limit.",
