            "Comment": "There are many more chargers than listed here. There are at least 4 bays with 7kW AC plugs, and a rapid charger. 1Hr free parking if you are charging. This is run by EB Charging, and requires RFID or their app. However, the app is not particularly reliable - I, and a neighbouring user had to call suppor to initiate charge, as payment was not accepted.",
