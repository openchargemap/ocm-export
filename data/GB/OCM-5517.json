            "Comment": "These are simply 13A outlets. No RFID card is required. Just turn up and plug in. Only problems are:\n\n1. The store does not prevent ICE cars from parking in the bays and, since the bays are conveniently situated near the shop entrance, they are often occupied.\n2. There is no security for the plug or for your EVSE. Anyone can unplug your EVSE and walk off with it unless you padlock it to your car.\n\nI do not know if the outlets are operational after the store closes.",
