            "Comment": "Did not work when we arrived.  Carpark attendants were exceptionally helpful and rebooted charge point. Still didn't work but they agreed to let us part there while we went to the cinema.  On our return it was fixed and charging worked fine.  They are now putting no parking cones across the front to stop other vehicles parking there so it is reserved for EVs.  Staff really helpful and always around if you get stuck.  The management situation is poor though, you have to find and attendent to be let out of the carpark if you have charged.  Great to encourage EV use great staff but please someone further up sort the system out.",
