            "Comment": "Tried using these...they are right next to the NCP Booth, but that doesnt stop ICE Drivers parking there..The Car Park man said he would start coning them off, and that they have had a site survey for more....lets hope they can be used solely for EV's. The two here atpresent are on the end of a line of bays and you cannot park the other side as you will be on a double yellow. NCP is Expensive.",
