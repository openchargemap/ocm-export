            "Comment": "The Siemens Rapid unit will no longer accept Plugged-in-Midland as it is being handed over to Charge-your-Car, but a CYC card will not respond either (it shows no activity at all to my CYC card, not even the spinning 'wait' icon) and CYC deny that they have any info on this charger. I did get my Source East card to work in the end, but I'm told that it shouldn't have worked. Until this is sorted out, the charger is a unknown quantity. Don't depend on it. Note also, there appears to a duplicate entry on OpenChargeMap for the Rapid.",
