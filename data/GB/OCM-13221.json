There are four parking bays next to these posts (to the right of the Angus Council reception) that used to be reserved for disabled, but now not. No EV-only signs. They are connected and are displaying a message asking for a CYC card. Reception says they were recently commissioned, but there is a problem preventing them from working. This needs more investigation. Reception staff believe they are for public use and there are no barriers or gates on this car park.",
