At present it is unmarked hence easily ICEd. \n\nIf ICEd, here is the workaround used by me on several occasions:\nDrive past the charger space and turn immediately right onto footpath/golf cart track. \nDrive onto grass and park by charger\nCharge!\nGet coffee, lunch, whatever and tell Dalmahoy how much you appreciate the facility\n\nA request: Please roll up the cable after use and push the \"nozzle\" up into the hole under the charger unit. This keeps grass and muck out of it  ",

    "GeneralComments": "70A Tesla HPC - tested on a half dozen occasions. A great gateway to Edinburgh and the rest of Scotland for Tesla Roadster drivers. The coordinates represent the space with the Tesla HPC adjacent. It will be worth calling ahead to ask for the space to be coned off, especially on weekends when use of adjacent golf facilities is intensive and the space is often in use. Please when visiting inform the concierge and spend some money to thank the Marriot Dalmahoy Hotel and Country Club for the investment they put into creating this facility. This location was visited during the first John O'Groats to Lands End drive End-to-End of the UK by a production electric vehicle using public charging (search \"Tesla End-to-End\").",
