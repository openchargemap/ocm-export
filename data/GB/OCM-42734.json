            "Comment": "Have just spoke to chargemaster. Apparently for their posts, acceptance of regional charge scheme cards is done on a per-post basis, and source east / source london acceptance is only provisioned on charge posts around the border of charge schemes. This one probably should have been configured for either, but it hadn't been, so it will be reconfigured to accept Source London.  Polar network cards should work on all Chargemaster labelled posts across the UK, regardless of locatio .",
