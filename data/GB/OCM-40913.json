            "Comment": "The E-volt equipment appears functional and is nicely protected under a shelter, but we could not try to charge because the two designated spaces (nicely marked in bright green) were occupied by ICE vehicles. When checking in for our ferry we asked about this and discovered that the person checking us in, and another member of staff, were using these spaces as staff parking.  Whilst the staff memberoffered to move her car, this clearly wasn't practical when there was a queue of passengers waiting to check in. Therefore, we advise anyone planning to charge here should arrive in plenty of time, in case the cars need to be moved. On our return journey, when we disembarked from the ferry we again saw ICE cars occupying these EV-charger spaces. Given that there is lots of parking space it shouldn't be a problem for the staff to move their cars...",
