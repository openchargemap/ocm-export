The nearby Orchard cafe and countryside park are highly recommended for refreshment and/or exercise while charging is taking place.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the Rapid charger is a charging post with two 7kW Type 2 sockets and a label saying this is part of the Plugged-in-Midlands network. The PiM website says these are for staff and visitors, am checking with Worcestershire Council whether these are available for longer stay members of the public visiting the adjacent country park.",
