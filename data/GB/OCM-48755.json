            "Comment": "Just a comment that this charging point is operational and it is a shame that rarely see anyone else using it.  The charger is not in the main Institute site; instead as you head down Macaulay Drive, go further on and follow the signs for the First Class nursery. After turning off Macaulay drive towards the nursery, go straight down and it is the first parking bays on your righthandside after the nursery entrance.  The charger is accessible at all times and you do not feel like you are entering a staff car park since it is an open area.  If you are staying at the Hilton 'Treetops' hotel you can drop your car off and walk across the greenspace or back roads to get back to the hotel - on foot you do not need to go the long way around via the Springfield Road.",
