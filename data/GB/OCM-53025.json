Polar Instant cards accepted as well as Source London. \r\nAlso an Elektromotive manufactured post (Elektrobay 165 dual) which, apparently erroneously, accepts CYC as well as Source London. Elektromotive unit has no branding, and has Powershare that limits charge to 16A when two vehicles connected. Elektromotive unit seems to take quite a while to authorize cards at the start and end of a session.",
