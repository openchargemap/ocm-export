I didn't actually plug in, but I did test the 4 rfid cards I have.\r\nSource East, Ecotricity and CYC are refused.\r\nOld Source London card appears to be accepted.\r\nThis is a car park for commuters getting the train into London, there were only a few cars when I visited on a Saturday morning.  A couple bays have traffic cones in them, there were more broken cones in the bushes, perhaps an attempt to prevent ICEing?",
