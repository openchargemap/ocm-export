            "Comment": "The equipment appeared to be operational, but we could not charge. I have the ChargeYourCar app, which should have allowed me to charge, but when we tried to use this point,  I simply received an error message saying that the system could not communicate with the charger unit.  I will report this to ChargeYourCar. In the meantime, someone with a ChargeYourCar card might have better luck.  We also noticed that the space in front of this charging unit is designated as a disabled parking space, not for EV-cvars, so would-be-chargers-might find their place blocked by a legitimate ICE car.",
