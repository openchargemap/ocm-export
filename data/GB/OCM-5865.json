            "Comment": "Have charged Tesla Roadster here about half dozen times during 2011 most recently 3 December 2011. \n\nExcellent set up. Gate to charging in under 60 seconds. Please advise hotel you are charging and expect to pay Â£15 (normal parking fees are then waived).\n\nNo support for non-Tesla vehicles yet but several local Charge Your Car scheme points available. \n\nFood in the hotel is good and rooms are comfortable. \n\nIt's pleasant to walk along the river. Cross the pedestrian bridge outside and it's an easy walk up into central Durham and all the way up to the Cathedral. ",
