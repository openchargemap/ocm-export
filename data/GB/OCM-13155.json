            "Comment": "Found the charging station easily, right hand corner near the building's entrance.  Charging didn't work at all well.  It kept giving an \"unable to charge battery\" message in the dashboard after about 1% charge, 5 mins.  The error might go away after 5 mins, and then charge another 1% before giving the same error again.  After about 2 repeats of this cycle the error remained and wouldn't reset.  Gave up attempting to charge.\nEnjoyed watching a traffic warden put a ticket on a Mercedes ICE that was parked in the other EV bay!",
