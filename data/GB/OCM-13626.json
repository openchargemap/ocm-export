Although they are Chargemaster branded posts, they are not part of the network and have no smartcard reader.\r\n\r\nI asked at the ticket office (200 yards away) and the staff knew exactly how to enable the points. On return, you need to get the post deactivated to be able to remove the cable but again the staff knew exactly what to do.\r\n\r\nOnly downside was an inconsiderate/incompetent driver who parked across two spaces using one charge point but making the second inaccessible.",

Free to use though presumably only if you visit Waddesdon Manor.\r\n\r\nWorked perfectly - though it was not clear initially that you needed to see the staff at the ticket office (about 30 metres away) who have physical keys to enable the chargers.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWord of warning - to disconnect your vehicle, the (volunteer?) staff need to unlock the charger again, so check when the ticket office closes!",

Car park staff at this well known attraction were very unhelpful and at one point even said I wouldn't bother it doesn't work anyway! all in all a bit stressful especially to those who drive a long distance and then have a worrisome time wondering how on earth they are going to get home again! Also, note that charging point only has x2 13A sockets so even if it does work in the future don't expect a rapid charge! ",
