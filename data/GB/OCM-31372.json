I had to call Chargeplace Scotland to start the charge as my CPS card hadn't arrived yet. If you go into Burger King or any of the other shops they have a machine that can validate the parking ticket for free parking (I think it's up to 4 hours).",

Tried several times to get the charge going but unsuccessful.......ended up using one of the fast chargers on the same level, level one, (down the ramp), whilst the Mrs did her shopping. Didn't really matter though 'cause after several hours wandering the shopping centre the car was more or less fully charged upon return.",

Good to see a city car club leaf charging there too.\nHad to pay £3.50 for park, couldn't find an attendant to see if it was free as CYC site suggested.\n Chademo only charged Leaf to 90%, couldn't restart and persuade it to give me more, but enough to get home to Glasgow.\nPub/coffee shop over road did good coffee, and sainsbury's local for provisions.",
