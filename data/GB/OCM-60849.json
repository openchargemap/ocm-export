            "Comment": "Single PodPoint pole (Ella-Rose) with two 7Kw charge points (A & B). When I arrived A looked as if it was down slow (flash blue to red) so choose B (constant blue). Plugged in and got green light and started charging. Followed instructions to confirm charge location on PodPoint web site. Got confirmation nice and quick but after 15mins charging stopped as if not confirmed. Tried again with same result. Socket B now flashing blue then red. As 11pm left voicemail on support line and drove very slowly home!",
