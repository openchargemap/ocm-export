            "Comment": "The only problem is that there are two charging points but only one parking space allocated for EV's. On the left of the present space is the entrance to a funeral directors and the other side is allocated for disabled drivers. Not well thought out as if there is one car already charging there is no space for a second car to park in order to charge",
