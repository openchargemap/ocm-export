I did not have my CYC card with me so I phoned CYC for assistance and they were unable to help; they reported the fault to an engineer to check the unit. On 5th Sept 2015 I returned with my CYC card and charged successfully without any difficulties.",

I switched to the 22kw post, but it wouldn't recognise RFID, and the mobile reception was so bad I could not start a charge via the CYC app (although I could see the post was available on the app).\n\nI switched back to the rapid charger and on this attempt it seemed to charge at a normal Rapid rate although still reported a 1 hour 40mins charging estimate (charge was actually complete in 45mins).\n\nI reported both chargers to CYC for check up/repair.",

On the first attempt the handshake with the car failed, displaying an incorrect battery charge level of 85% on the charger, and preventing charge.
