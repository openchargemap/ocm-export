            "Comment": "The first post didn't recognise either my source London or Chargemaster card. The second one worked fine with my source London. Parked at 7pm on a Monday night and left at 10pm. It seems that on weekdays the car park may be open overnight. There was a sign indicating it is closed overnight at the weekend at some point. Agreed that it is very difficult to find. I drove down what appeared to be a pedestrian walk, turned right and right again.",

            "Comment": "Source london tag not recognised, which seems to be a common error on elektromotive points. Charge your Car tag worked. Ppints were flashing up all sorts of errors related to not having date/time set. It looks like these haven't been properly commissioned. Located in chargeable car park. I turned up outside of chargeable parking hours so couldn't ask if parking fees apply. Source london website has this as an on-street location,  not within car park. Location is not the easiest to access from the main road, off a maze of one-way streets.",
