            "Comment": "This appears to still be broken.  It was broken in September when I desperately needed a charge (even though it was marked as working).  Seems last and only check in is the only time its worked.\n\n I reported the failure to the staff in the adjoining building, they couldn't care less.  Guess that's how it is with a free charger, once its broken its never repaired.\n\nTweeted to Cairngorm who said it was someone else.  Talk about taking ownership.   Point would be as well taken down from site.",
