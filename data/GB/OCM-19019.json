            "Comment": "I walked past it today.\r\nA single post between the first two parking spaces on entering the car park (Iceland side). \r\nThere is no signage, the bays are not marked.\r\nThere was an badly parked ICE car in the 2nd spot, I chose not to use the 1st bay, beacuse I would have made it difficult for lorries getting to Waitrose loading bay, and would have stuck out more than I would have liked into the access road into the car park.\r\nwhen I returned 10 minutes later, an ICE car was in the other bay, making it difficult for other vehicles to get into the car park!\r\n\r\nunit says source london and chargemaster on it.\r\nlooked like it was ready to go,\r\nthe magnetic locks on the covers over the two type 2 sockets were not secure, so I could lift the flap and see the sockets\r\n",

            "Comment": "Today I could have done with a top up, but I couldn't. There are two posts, with double charging points, in a row of 4 spaces, which could also be accessed from the 4 bays on the other side of the barrier (so 8 possible spaces), but all the spaces where taken by ICE cars. Not that I can really blame them, because there is no signage. I only spotted the first charging post by accident on a previous visit, and on that previous visit, I didn't even notice that the 2nd post.",
