            "Comment": "This charger is right round behind the hotel, its in a good location for 2 cars to charge, and has a big sign up notifying non-EV users of a fine for use.  That said it was partially ICE'd when I used it, I was able to squeeze between 2 cars parked either side of the charger.  Turns out both ICE cars were actually staff vehicles as I was still charging when they finished their shift.  They've obviously seen EVs before because they made every effort to avoid eye contact.",
