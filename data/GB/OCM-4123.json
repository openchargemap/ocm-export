I'd phoned ahead to check it was working a few days before but arriving first thing in the morning seems unpopular with it. I'd regard it's reliability as slightly marginal at present, I only have a 1/3 success rate with it. The next nearest 10A/16A charging point is in Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh, and it's an easy place to pass a few hours of slow charging!",

He called me when he got to the dealership and I reached him 20 minutes later. His LEAF was charging on the CHAdeMO DC. After just a few minutes of getting a coffee and starting to chat the dealer (Jim, a truly nice guy) came over to say that the charge was at 87%. A few more minutes and it was done. \n\nFirst time I've witnessed DC fast charge - very impressive. It truly extends the range of an EV in a very practical way.  \n ",
