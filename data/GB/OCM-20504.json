Got here put car on charge in point A did not work so put in point B it also did not work so I tried again and it wouldn't release the charge cable Tried to ring pod point but couldn't get through spent another ten mins trying to get it out. rang pod point again got answer machine so threatened to dismantle the point to get my cable back. went to customer services they tried to turn off the point still didn't release. then pod point rang me back and tried a few things but would not work so pod point told the sainsburys guys to turn it off again this time for 30 seconds and also remove my cable from the car. this time the cable released. DO NOT USE till the point is fixed this all wasted 40 mins of my time and if sainsburys weren't open i would have dismantled the point no way i was leaving a £165 cable there. ",
