            "Comment": "The filling station staff have a 32A commando to 13A adapter they can lend you if you need an emergency charge on a more 'normal' EV; a slow charge - this was the only time I've wished I had a 32A portable EVSE - but nice enough location and the food is exceptionally good for a motorway services. Ecotricity are due here soon with their Electric Highway, until then, excellent in emergencies, I'd stop here even if I didn't need a charge for the food and produce.",

Note I arrived at southbound side and followed signs to \"Hotel\" to get to Northbound side. Free wifi on site. ",

            "Comment": "Have charged here 3 or 4 times in 2011 most recently around mid September. \n\nWhen first visiting there was a 32A blue \"Commando\" socket. Now there is also a Tesla HPC at 70A. I have charged the Tesla Roadster from both (using an MC240 at 30A for the 32A case).\n\nThey are very friendly and helpful at Tebay Westmorland services. \n\nTo access the charger follow the very large \"Tesla Charger\" signs. You can access it whether from Northbound (the side its on) or Southbound (you are led over a bridge to Northbound). You have to sign in and collect a key at the petrol station forecourt. The key unlocks a padlock on the switch that powers the charger. \n\nThere is a very nice hotel if you are staying overnight and a farm shop plus restaurant if you aren't. \n\nWiFi is free. ",
