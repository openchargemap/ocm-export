            "Comment": "A tad challenging to find, the car park for the dragon is up a very, seriously narrow lane to the side of the pub. Once you have negotiated this the charger is easy to spot on your left hand side, follow the cables as you come though. Changer was operational however there seemed to be too much going on at the pub for it to successful charge my Zoe. \n\nStaff tired to help but as it was coming up to kick off for a Welsh game we said not to worry. We will be back in the future ",
