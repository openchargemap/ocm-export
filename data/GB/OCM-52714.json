            "Comment": "I'm guessing the 3 hour parking restriction stops it been used as an all day parking place & lets other owners charge there cars if needed.. They need more charging spaces if they want to encourage train passengers to leave there cars plugged in all day when it only takes 3 to 4 hours to charge most electric cars..  At least they now fine ice vehicles if found in the spaces.. ",

            "Comment": "This is the only place to park for the railway station but there seems to be a time limit of 3 hours.  So I can park my car, charge it and go to london then have to turn round immediately to come and take my car off charge. No chance to do any work.  Surely if you want to encourage commuters to use EVs there needs to be more thought than this and definitely more points.  Bedford you are way behind milton keynes on this front.",
