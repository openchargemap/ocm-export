            "Comment": "I charged at this point this afternoon. Initially & despite swiping a few times the charge point wouldn't recognise my card & flashed red & so I tried the other side to see if the whole charge point was out of action but it accepted it so I had one last go on the side I had parked & it worked. Just wanted to let others know that it was being a bit temperamental & not to give up if trying to use.",
