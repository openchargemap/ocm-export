            "Comment": "right hand post also works on older Source London card.\r\nNotice on nearby posts suggests that these two charge points are due to be replaced with three charge points. It looks to be a Source London doing, since the council notice suggests that the council will not be charging EVs to park while charging in this otherwise pay-by-phone car park.",
