            "Comment": "Charged here for 20 minutes or so while using the toilet and buying a couple of things from the shop. The actual motorway services are quite dated with a Burger King and KFC on the bridge between North- and South-bound, so I chose not to stay longer and eat. \nHowever, the EV side of the experience is excellent, provided you have an Ecotricity \"for the road\" card. It's well worth getting as they focus on Welcome Break service statins to allow transit charging. And the card is currently free to all (not just Ecotricity customers).\nAs you approach on the motorway you are greeted with an EV with plug logo right under the \"Petrol\" on the main sign for Charnock Richard Services. This is exceptionally welcoming and very refreshing to see EV refuelling on a par with ICE. \nI just drove to the front door of the main building and there were two very well marked bays with bright green EV charging markings on the road. Even though they were closest to the front door they weren't ICEd. Maybe because it was late evening. But probably because it was so well marked. \nThe chargers have blue LEDs along the top. I was able to present my Ecotricity card still in my wallet to unlock the posts. Plugged in a Mennekes to Tesla cable and it started charging at 32A. Car did throw a fleeting error message but no problem. No problems disconnecting at the end. \nOverall this was my best ever rock up, follow signs, see chargers, park, connect cable, start charging experience. Faster than a petrol station refuel!",
