However, had a problem trying to charge as none of the LED lights  (inc 'Ready') not on as it always has been when I have used it before but unit had power as fans were whirring and screen said \"Nissan Rapid Charger' or something similar.  Mr Grumpy helpfully sorted it out for me by touching the screen which apparently woke up the unit from some sort of stand-by mode.  Charged fine thereafter.  MW",
