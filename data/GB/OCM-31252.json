On return to the vehicle later that afternoon somebody had removed our charging cable from the point, less than 20 mins into the charge! Result - not enough charge for the journey home, had to wait to recharge : /  .. NOTE TO PROVIDER: as with the 'car end' and other charging stations, please update the hardware to lock the cable when in use!",
