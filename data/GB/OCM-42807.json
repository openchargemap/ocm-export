            "Comment": "4 bays EV only parking 05:00 to 09:00 then parking for all cars, so hit & miss. Have to buy an all day parking ticket - Â£3.95 off peak, which is expensive for a couple of hours shopping in Eastbourne, but not too bad if you're on holiday & wandering off to the seafront for a few hours. Parking man told me that they are probably going to make them all day EV spaces soon. ",
