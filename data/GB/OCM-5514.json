Powered  but staff explained its not releasing charge cables unless they power down the whole system. If you are desperate  and can wait for staff once you get enough range to move on maybe worth a try.",

However my Renault Zoe refused to charge on either of the sockets.\n\nThe car park staff were great and said other cars had used the points earlier in the day. It may be the Zoe has an issue with this.",
