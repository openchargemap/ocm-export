            "Comment": "It looks like MK Council have migrated this car park location from Pod Point to Chargemaster Posts, and they take polar network cards (or app), charge no longer free - parking is though for EVs. (It can work out a bit more expensive than parking an ICE vehicle in this car park - £1.40 per hour).",
