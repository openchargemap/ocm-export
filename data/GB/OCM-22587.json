            "Comment": "I attempted to charge my Renault Zoe on this Charge Your Car (CYC) charger but it kept dropping the charge. \n I contacted CYC and received the following reply:\n\"Regarding the charging issues. Unfortunately we have had numerous problems with the Zoe not getting along with charge points for various reasons, it seems to have quite a few quirks. One particular issue we have is that when you plug a Zoe in it checks the earthing of the charge point (it’s the only electric car to do this). If it isn’t happy with the earthing it will refuse to charge so it all depends upon the conductivity of the ground. This can vary depending upon recent weather conditions so what we’ve found is that certain charge points may work one day then not another. The fact that it’s worked for you in the past would suggest this is the cause of the fault and unfortunately there is little we can do about it. I could only suggest speaking to Renault.\"",
