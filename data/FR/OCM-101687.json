    "GeneralComments": "I got a consistent 17kW. When we spoke to the Visitor Information centre in the village they recommended I use this charger and said they had recently requested that the site be cleared for EV access (the BMW Ice Driving business only operates between December and mid March, and now this charging point was covered in snow, hence they had put up a chain indicating access was restricted). But it was easy for me to remove/unhook the chain to gain access to the site and clear the snow away from around the charging point with a shovel in order to get to the charging socket. Pressed the green button to unlock the cover and connected my type 3c charging  cable.  Provider is Cimes Energies (Électricité solaire).",
