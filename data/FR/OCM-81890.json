            "Comment": "I spoke with someone at the check-in desk of L'Aigle des Neiges Hôtel about their Type 2 Tesla destination chargers: he confirmed they are free for customers staying there, but that anyone else can bring their car to use a charger for EUR15 (fair enough I thought). But he also said they would take it down into their parking garage themselves and bring it back out later on when done (.. which is the part I'm a little uneasy about. If I do decide to go ahead with that, I'll try convince then to let me do that myself). ",
