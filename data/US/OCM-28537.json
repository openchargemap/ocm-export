            "Comment": "Dealership staff seems to be incompetent. Nobody knows how to use, nevermind troubleshoot the chargers. I had an issue with the chademo charger. Went in to ask for help, and was told I was doing it improperly. The staff member, John (a sales manager), then proceeded to attempt to charge while not connected. He then tried to convince me that my need to charge was not an issue. I regret buying a Nissan every time I have to visit a dealer to charge. Please, save yourself the hassle and assume their incompetence persists with no functional charging. ",
