            "Comment": "Charged on level 3 twice, it worked well.  The fast charge station on the right didn't recognize a 2025 chevy equinox with either connector, but the one on the left worked flawlessly.  Both connectors can charge at the same time.  The cables seeemed long enough to accommodate many port locations.",
