            "Comment": "The Equipment Info page for this EVSE incorrectly shows one 110V outlet and two J1772 plugs, OCM-CN-15689 and OCM-CN-20640.  There is only one 110V outlet and one J1772 plug.  As can be seen at http://www.chargepoint.com/guides, none of their EVSEs that have a 110V outlet also have twin J1772 plugs.  Please update the Equipment Info page to list only one J1772 plug.",
