            "Comment": " 4 level 2 charging stations on Greenlots network. I use 2-3 times a week very convenient. Only once was I unable to charge due to availability of spots (taken by non EV's). The hospital has been doing a good job of warning non-EV's parked there with warning stickers,  although there are occasionally EV's that don't remove their cars after charging and sometimes EV's park while not plugged in at all.",
