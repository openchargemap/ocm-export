            "Comment": "We are excited to announce that we have replaced the existing EV Charger with a new GoSpace EVM7700 Dual Charging Station with our new Open Charge system, EVSuite. AAA is still offering FREE charging. Just follow the instructions on the large 8-inch monitor.  Swipe any credit card to activate the EV Charger. While you are there, feel free to stop into the AAA Heathrow Branch which is inside the building, to the left of the main lobby for all your traveling and membership needs. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the GoSpace Support team at 813.421.5121.",
