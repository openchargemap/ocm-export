            "Comment": "Very negative experience. I tried to charge at one charger (Milton), but it wouldnâ€™t connect to my car, so I moved to another charger (Ursula). I successfully charged at Ursula; however, my account somehow remained open on Milton all day, and I was charged for someone else charging at Milton that evening, when I was hundreds of miles away. EV Go support has refused to resolve the issue. Extremely frustrating. I intend to avoid EV Go chargers in the future because of their terrible support.",
