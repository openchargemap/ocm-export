I called Shell Recharge customer service and they attempted to address the issue remotely but the unit did not respond. I asked the support agent if I should try to reset the emergency stop. They said it wouldn’t help. After getting off the phone, I decided to reset the emergency stop button and that actually cleared the fault. I was then able to charge.",
