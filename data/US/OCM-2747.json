            "Comment": "This charger is a 220 and it worked fairly quick.  The access button is available for anyone to push so make sure your charge lights are correct on both the car and charger.  It wouldn't hurt to check it every hour or so.  It is also better to wait for a 80% or more charge if heading to Santa Rosa.  It takes that much to get there.",
