    "GeneralComments": "Plug-In NCW is happy to announce the validation of a 70A charger at the 59er Diner located at Coles Corner on Highway 2. This location provides a charging opportunity between Stevens Pass and Leavenworth. It delivers 238 Volts at 68 Amps for 50 miles of range per hour of charge. The 59er Diner is a favorite eating place for many traveling Highway 2 plus they have cabins for rent. They also serve one of the best milkshakes in the state! Across the highway you will find a Put Put Golf course and walking trails. There is also a convenience store and small hotel located within a short walk. Coles Corner is at the intersection of Highway 2 and SR 207 which is the Lake Wenatchee State Park turnoff. Charging is free, but donations will be accepted to help with maintenance and expansion. ",
