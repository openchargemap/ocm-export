        "AccessComments": "We are conveniently located between Terra Nova National Park and Gross Morne National Park just 20 km west of Grand Falls-Windsor. For those of you from the East Coast, we are 420 km from St. John’s. Why drive another 2.5 hours to get to the west coast when you can stay in the best quality rental chalets in Newfoundland with excellent snowmobiling?  Your gas savings alone will cover a night in the chalet. From Corner Brook you can take the trail to the Gaff Topsails, head East and get here by snowmobile almost as fast as you can drive here by vehicle! We are right on the Trans Canada Trail. You can’t miss us! ",
