            "Comment": "We stayed at the Brookstreet Hotel September 23 and 24, checking out on the 25th. The Tesla chargers were just through the gate inside the parking lot and most convenient to the elevator to the lobby. We charge successfully overnight both nights and had the company of another Tesla in the next station. This is very handy and one of the reasons we chose to stay at the Brookstreet.",
