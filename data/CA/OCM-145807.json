            "Comment": "All Stations Broken - Yet another completely non-functioning Petro-Canada charger. Travelling from Montreal to Victoria, and we've found only two out nine that work. The station attendant in Moose Jaw was very friendly, but courtesy is not electricity for a stranded continental driver.  And worst of all... The app is showing at this moment that one of the two stations is operational (but it is not).   Get all the way, again, to be disappointed yet again.  I'm going to invest in a charging startup. Clearly this market is ripe for some competition. ",
