    "GeneralComments": " They require some RFID chip, which only the staff has. The good thing is, it also locks your cable in place at the plug, the bad thing is you need the staff both to connect and disconnect. The light on the charger is blue when in standby. It must switch to \"green\" to enable power, and it will go to green once the lid over the plug is closed. If it doesn't turn green, open and close the lid again, make sure it locks in place (to engage the green light).\r\n\r\nCharging is included in the parking fee, but there are only two spots, and they are only 13A (= 50 hours to fully charge a Tesla Model S 85). You need to call the staff again, before you leave, to have it unlocked again. Still better than nothing. Tried it successfully September 24th with Tesla Model S. Both stands were blocked with cones, to help prevent \"ICEing\".",
