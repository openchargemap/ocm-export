            "Comment": "Three spots, just after entering the car park. All three have 13A / 230V (2 kW) but also one station of J1772 with a cable that seems long enough to reach all three spots. NOTE: Requires membership of EVPower. There is an app E-charge for iOS (don't know about Android). We got management to activate a 13A spot for us (Tesla Model S cannot take J1772 without an adapter, which I don't know when will be available).",
