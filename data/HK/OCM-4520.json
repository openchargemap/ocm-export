Just before exit back to road, turn right and DOWN into the entry for the car park. You start on 17th floor, keep going DOWN until 11th floor. Note a lot of traps of going \"wrong way\", keep turning (right), don't go straight (into \"wrong way\"), all the way down to 11/F",

    "GeneralComments": "Go to 17th floor, office just outside elevator TWO times: Just after parking and say you parked an electric car (present the ticket you got from the machine at entry). They will write EV on your ticket (in Chinese). Go there the SECOND time, when you want to leave again, then you have 15 minutes to exit. HINT: Have one person exit the car after you get the ticket, AND have passed the gate. That person brings ticket to 17/F (quite close to entry gate), while the driver goes to level 11 (for Tesla Superchargers) or level 11/12 for other chargers. It might have a read light on the street saying \"Parking Full\" despite empty spots inside (especially for charging)",
