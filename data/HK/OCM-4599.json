Go OUT again, a few hundred meters on the (one way) Tuen Yan Street, onto Tuen Fat Road, TMTP Phase 3 has much better parking. Neither charging spots worked (tested 25 Sep 2014)",

    "GeneralComments": "Contributors Note: \r\nVERY complicated procedure, charging didn't work (25 Sep 2014) ,difficult walking access between parking-shroff-mall, very narrow inside, both turns and spots (apart from charging spots, plenty room there). With no power, went back up to entrance (very long walk), they gave me a key, with which I could open the installation box. A timer was inside, it was set to on. I tried both boxes, neither gave any power. It seems like it was turned off remotely, maybe at the fuse panel somewhere. After 15 minutes I gave up, to got to Phase 1 (much better, and very close by). They still charged me 12 HKD, despite I told them the charger didn't work, and I had to leave again. AVOID AT ALL COST until this is fixed (report back here please)",
