            "Comment": "The Gold Coast phase I and II are in the wrong positions (see Google Maps for instance, for the location of Phase I and II). They are also both in a private compound and thus NOT open to public use. The one in Gold Coast Shopping Mall is public, although the price for parking there is up to 24 HKD pr hour (depending what time is parked, it is a Sino parking garagage in the basement of the shopping mall). Charging is \"free\" as long as you pay the parking charge, but at a meagre 13A, it would take several days to fully charge a Tesla Model S for instance.",
