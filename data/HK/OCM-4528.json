            "Comment": "Too bad it is only 13A charging, like 95% of all charging stations in Hong Kong. Apart from that, when you enter Megabox they will try to wave you upstairs (left turn). You have to stop and tell them you are in an electric car, and they will guide you downstairs, towards B1/B2 (just follow the green EV charging signs). Buy for more than 200 HKD, and parking is free up to three hours. Charger by CLP, it might eventually carry a cost but at the moment it's free. Requires octopus to activate it.",
