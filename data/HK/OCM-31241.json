You need your own Type-2 cable (the thick blue cable that comes with Tesla Model S), and it will lock in the charging station as well - requires the EV-link to unlock the cable again (or using the E-charge app from HK EVpower. Parking is 16HKD/hr on weekdays, 13HKD/h on weekends and public holidays. With 32A charging, it's worth it, take a walk to the Lai Chi Kok MTR near by and leave the car charging while doing your business, charging at around 32 km/h (Tesla Model S). Staff seem very focused on the chargers not being blocked by ICE cars, not even by an EV NOT charging. I wasn't even done parking when a staff member came to ask 1) are you parking and 2) will you be charging. ",
