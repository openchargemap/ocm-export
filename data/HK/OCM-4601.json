            "Comment": "The slowest charger you can get - but if you need to park in Yuen Long anyway, a bug standard BS1363 wall outlet will give you about 9 km/hr charging. You will most probably need an MCB key to unlock the box with the plug - get it from the attendant or buy your own (~25 HKD for a set including a lock!). They have day rates around 65 HKD, or 16 HKD pr hour. About to be adjusted, and different times, different rates - but around those amounts. Charging spots are properly coned off, shouldn't be ICEd.",
