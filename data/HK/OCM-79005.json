They will write EV on your ticket (in Chinese). Go there the SECOND time, when you want to leave again, then you have 15 minutes to exit. HINT: Have one person exit the car after you get the ticket, AND have passed the gate. That person brings ticket to 17/F (quite close to entry gate), while the driver goes to level 11 (for Tesla Superchargers) or level 11/12 for other chargers. It might have a read light on the street saying \"Parking Full\" despite empty spots inside (especially for charging)",
