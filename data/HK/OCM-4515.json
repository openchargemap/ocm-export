            "Comment": "2 13A spots is correct. One stand is often used by Sino Parkings own Nissan Leaf. Price between 12 to 24 HKD pr hour to park, certain discounts if shopping at the shopping mall, but don't expect to get much out of this spot unless you have a Nissan Leaf, Renault Twizy (not allowed in Hong Kong) or electric scooter (also, none of these allowed in Hong Kong). If you need to park there anyway, 13A is better than nothing. Upgrade to 32A or more would be very helpful.",
