            "Comment": "I was there with my Model S. There was a Nissan Leaf charging with this ChaDeMo, it seemed to be working. There were NO other charging options as I checked, although there are two spots reserved for EVs. Since Tesla Motors didn't yet release their ChaDeMo converter, I couldn't have used it in any case. There was some road works so the Western entrance was closed up entirely. It's a private estate - not sure how the access is after the construction finishes - it MIGHT be for residents only.",
