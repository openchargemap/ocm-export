            "Comment": "\nFurther info: Once inside choose the LEFT entry lane and make a LEFT turn. The charging spot is against the far left wall, behind a wall sticking out. Location is on UB (the same as when you enter the parking), but in order to exit, you have to drive to the LB level, through that, up again, befor you can exit. 700 meter driving, just to get out (!). It works fine, though slow as 13A BS1363 are. 2 hours free parking if you shop a few hundred HKD.",

Staff was very helpful to call the owner over the speaker system, allow us to park in front of the Audi, lend us an extension cable. Later they called us so we could move the car correctly into position and remove the extension cable. The staff was very helpful and enthusiastic.",
