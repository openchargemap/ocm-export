    "GeneralComments": "Public AC charger (22kW max). Payment with Wevolt App. Buckland Inn (Pub) is nearby and there is a shop at the Petrol Station on the Tasman Highway across from the site. Buckland Park is only 300m away (on corner of Burnett and East Streets) and has public toilets, electric BBQs, picnic shelter, and children's playground. The site is adjacent to The Storekeeper's Boutique Accommodation. The parking area near the charger is long and parallel to the roadway so should be suitable for an EV towing a trailer.",
