    "GeneralComments": "Tritium Veefil set at nominal 40 kw powered by generator. Please call the road house ahead with your ETA. On arrival go to the counter and ask for Proprietor Wade Clatworthy or son Jarryd to assist with starting the generator and removing the dust cover from the charger.  Once the generator is running switch on the power to the Veefil using the isolator switch on the wall left side. Veefil will do a 5 minute countdown ending with the \"plug into car symbol\" flashing left side of the panel. At this point unlock the padlock securing the plug to the charger and the plug into your car. Press START on the Veefil panel. You should hear the genset load up and the car will be receiving charge.  By all means grab a coffee, but please stay at the charger while the generator is running. Please keep note of the kwhr read out on the charger and please stop the charge with the STOP button rather than letting the car stop the charge. Once finished return the plug to the charger and lock it.  Go to counter to pay for your kwhrs at 70 cents and ask for help to turn of the generator and re-install the dust cover on the charger.  NOTE: if after the 5 minute countdown the \"plug into car\" symbol is not flashing, then press and hold all three buttons on the panel til Error 195 appears, then release and a new countdown will begin.",
