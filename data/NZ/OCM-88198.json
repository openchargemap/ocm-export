    "GeneralComments": "24/7\r\nThe Portobello Village Tourist Park is ideally located to allow you to explore the (very hilly) Otago Peninsula. You might take a stroll down to the pub or cafes while your battery charges, or to climb Cone Hill for magnificent views up and down Otago Harbour. If you want a longer walk, tramp over to Hoopers and Papanui Inlet. With prior arrangement (ring 03 478 0359), we can have bicycles delivered for day or part day hire. Most of the plugs are Blue Commando (16 Amp) but one household 3-point plug (8 Amp) is also available by the BBQ area. This park does not allow daytime visitors to use the showers â€“ please respect this requirement or the public charging service will need to be withdrawn.",
