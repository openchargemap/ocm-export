    "GeneralComments": "Normal camping fees apply for charging electric vehicles.\r\nKerr Bay campground is NOT a free charging site. It is a busy campground operating on a booking system during the summer. From mid-December to end of April everyone using the sites must book and pay the full rate online or at the Rotoiti/Nelson Lakes Visitor Centre. Normal camping fees apply for charging electric vehicles. From 1st May to mid-December vehicles using the powered sites for charging can do so 10am to 3pm for a donation payable at the Rotoiti/Nelson Lakes Visitor Centre. After 3pm the full camp fee must be paid as any vehicle charging is blocking the site from campers.\r\n",
