    "GeneralComments": "Caravan Mains Socket\r\nDaylight hours only\r\nStrath Taieri Hotel & Backpackers has a 16 Amp caravan styled plug just inside a set of double doors (it used to be used for a tanker’s pump). A standard 5-m longer charger lead will reach it from the roadside, but the need to have the doors open while charging precludes use of the charger at night (when that side of the hotel is locked). While charging you could visit many of Middlemarch’s cafes and eating places or their excellent Museum, or you can hire bikes for a zip down the Rail Trail. Strath Taieri Hotel & Backpackers even have a courtesy car that you can borrow (provided you show them your drivers’ license) to visit some of the local historical places, to take a walk up onto the Rock & Pillar Range, or visit Sutton Salt Lake (there is a superb walk around the lake and Department of Conservation Reserve).",
