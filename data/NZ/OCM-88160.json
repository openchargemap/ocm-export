Their motor camp is just over the road from the Matau branch of Clutha River – you could catch brown trout and maybe even a salmon in the river, or just dip your toes while your car battery recharges. There are also lots of local walks, a swimming pool and a Museum nearby. A modest charge ($1 per hour) is levied for day visits, but this will be waived if you stay overnight in one of their cabins or tent sites.",
