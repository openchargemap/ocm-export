    "GeneralComments": "24/7\r\nThe Danseys Pass Coach Inn has a 16 Amp caravan plug behind their hotel and an 8 Amp standard three-point plug in an outside ‘switch box’ attached to the power pole just in front of their hotel. Car parking alongside will allow a 5-m long charger lead to reach the plugs. Monica and Rodney offer use of the plugs free of charge, but you might like to return the compliment by having a meal or drink in their historic hotel, or even stay overnight. Danseys Pass is spectacular and good walks are available from the Inn. Check the weather and road conditions before setting out in winter.\r\n",
