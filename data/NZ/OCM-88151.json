At the moment they only have an 8 Amp 3-pt-plug outlet available in a shed that can be accessed by cars 24/7, but they will install a 16 Amp caravan plug if sufficient EV traffic appears. They will not charge for use of the socket, but why not have a meal or drink in their hotel, perhaps after tacking a short ride on a section of the Rail Trail which passes through Waipiata. Give them a ring on 03 444 9470 in advance if you need the 16 Amp outlet to see if it is installed yet.",
