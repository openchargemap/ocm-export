    "GeneralComments": "$2 per hour while charging, but a rebate may be negotiated if you are staying in the parks units or tent sites.\r\n24/7\r\nSeveral caravan charging (16Amp) plugs are available. Ranfurly is an Art Deco township and well worth a visit. Several cafes and places to eat are available while you charge. If you are carrying your own bikes, it is a great place to sample part of the Otago Rail Trail. The local school opens its swimming pool for visitors in the summer months.",
